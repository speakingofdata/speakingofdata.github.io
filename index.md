Harper developed a passion for speech processing while completing a masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. Working with speech corpora brings together their experience as an engineer, interest in language analysis, and expertise transforming sound.

Since graduating, they have been exploring linguistics and accessibility, and building tools for speech synthesis, TTS, ASR, and model evaluation. Many modern speech applications rely on proprietary data and cater to standardized clients. Harper is focused on finding ways open resources can provide greater flexibility for people with varied language experiences, such as users of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), non-native speakers, multi-lingual individuals, and languages with fewer digital resources.
