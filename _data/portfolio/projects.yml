- title: 'LJ2 Corpus'
  tagline: '1 voice, 26,200 transcribed sound files'
  description: 'Using the same voice and file formats as the popular LJ Speech Dataset, this corpus is 100% larger, can be segmented into 12-, 24-, or 48-hour units, and contains over 8x more source texts, representing a greater breadth of non-fiction subjects. Among other strategies, this corpus employs downsampling to increase alignment with modern word usage frequency, without overfitting. It can be combined with LJ Speech to provide 72 hours of recordings, used on its own, or as a replacement in any model designed to work with LJ Speech.'
